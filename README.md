# PIC-10C-final-project

I would like to create a project that allows someone to create a basic grid-like document for the different months of the year. 
The goal is to have an interface where the user enters basic information about the document such as number of columns needed, the specific 
month, and title of the documents. Then the program will create another window with the document where the user can make changes to specific days of the month and possibly some other basic editing options. Ideally I would like to try and have the program be able to transfer the created document to some format on the user's computer that can then be printed. However, I dont know how to go about doing the last part yet.
